 * Use this class to implement command pattern in the qgrid. The most of interactions in the q-grid are utilized by this pattern.
 *
 * ### Create a command using q-grid facade.
 *
 * ```javascript
 *	const addRowCommand = new qgrid.Command({
 *	   canExecute: () => true,
 *	   execute: () => {
 *	      const newRow = {
 *			 id: 1,
 *			 text: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'
 *	      };
 *
 *		  gridModel.data({
 *			 rows: gridModel.data().rows.concat(newRow)
 *		  });
 *	   },
 *	   shortcut: 'F7'
 *  });
 * ```
